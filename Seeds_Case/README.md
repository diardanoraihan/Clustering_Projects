# Clustering Analysis with KMeans: Seeds Dataset
## About the Data

So this is a seed data set and it's obtained from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds

`Abstract: Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct all seven, real-valued attributes.`

And basically what this is is an experiment in visualizing kernels and their actual features.

We will cluster the data with k=3 representing group of kernels three different varieties of wheat that is:
- Kama
- Rosa
- Canadian
